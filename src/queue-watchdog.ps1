# Two jobs, deliberately in ONE script -- "is this task actually stuck" answered in one
# place:
#
#   1. Dead-process detection: a heartbeat file whose PID isn't actually running anymore
#      means that process crashed. Restart the OS process. NEVER a git operation.
#   2. Reject-retry-requeue: a task genuinely REJECTED by review (has real ornithVotes,
#      not a crash/domain-error block) gets moved back to pending/ for a fresh redraft,
#      capped at $MaxOrnithRejectRetries attempts, tracked via `ornithRejectCount` on the
#      task JSON. KNOWN LIMITATION: this is a BLIND retry -- the redraft does not see WHY
#      it was rejected. A blind redraft can still fix transient issues (a genuinely empty/
#      degenerate first draft, which is documented to self-heal on a later call) but won't
#      fix a systematically wrong approach.
#
# This script's own failures must never cascade -- everything below is defensively
# try/catch'd per-item, so one bad heartbeat file or one bad blocked-task file never stops
# the rest of a pass, and the outer loop itself never dies from an unhandled exception.

# Tightened 2026-07-18 alongside ornith-client.js's 4-min REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS: no single
# Ornith call should run longer than that anymore (it either finishes or crashes the
# worker), so 8 min of "recently updated, fine" tolerance was pure added latency on top of
# an already-crashed process, not real caution. StaleHeartbeatSeconds keeps a modest margin
# above the 4-min call ceiling rather than matching it exactly, since review/apply passes
# route through this same instances/ heartbeat mechanism and aren't all bounded by that
# same client-side timeout. CheckIntervalSeconds is cheap regardless of value -- a handful
# of small JSON file reads plus Get-Process calls, no GPU/disk contention with Ornith.
$CheckIntervalSeconds = 10
$StaleHeartbeatSeconds = 300  # 5 min -- comfortably above the 4-min per-call ceiling
$MaxOrnithRejectRetries = 2

# Worker-only escape hatch for the "-NoExit zombie" failure mode: a worker crashes mid-call
# (ornith-client.js's 4-min REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS fires, the uncaught error terminates the
# script), but -NoExit keeps the PowerShell HOST process alive at an idle prompt after the
# script inside it dies. Test-ProcessAlive sees that lingering shell and returns true
# forever, so a worker that is provably dead by heartbeat never gets restarted -- reproduced
# live twice 2026-07-19, required a manual kill+restart both times (see
# docs/pipeline-incident-2026-07-19.md).
#
# Scoped to workers ONLY, not review-runner/apply-runner: those route through
# claude-code-cli, which has no equivalent bounded per-call timeout the way Ornith calls do,
# so a genuinely slow (not hung) review/apply pass is plausible and this script has no
# evidence tonight of either ever actually hanging. Applying the same aggressive treatment
# there risks killing real, still-in-progress work for no confirmed benefit.
#
# Matches $StaleHeartbeatSeconds exactly, not a larger "extra safety margin" value --
# tightened from an initial 15 min per operator feedback 2026-07-19: repeated crash-loop
# downtime compounds fast, and a bigger margin here doesn't actually buy any real safety.
# Nothing legitimate can leave a worker's heartbeat stale past the 4-min REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS
# ceiling without either finishing (heartbeat resets at the next pass) or crashing outright
# (caught by the PID-confirmed-dead path above, using this same 300s margin already). A
# separate named constant is kept anyway, not inlined as $StaleHeartbeatSeconds, so the two
# checks can be re-tuned independently later without re-deriving which is which.
$WorkerZombieThresholdSeconds = 300  # 5 min -- same margin as $StaleHeartbeatSeconds, see above

# Restart cooldown: THE duplicate-instance factory, found live 2026-07-19 (two worker-1
# processes spawned exactly 10s apart -- one $CheckIntervalSeconds). After Start-Process,
# the heartbeat file still holds the DEAD process's pid and stale lastHeartbeat until the
# replacement finishes starting up (node task-sources run, crash-resume scan) and writes
# its first heartbeat under its own pid. Every 10s pass in that window re-sees "stale +
# pid gone" and spawns ANOTHER replacement. The cooldown makes a restart decision sticky:
# once this watchdog restarts an instance, it will not restart that same instanceId again
# until the cooldown elapses, no matter what the (still-stale) heartbeat file says. 120s
# comfortably covers real startup time while staying well under the 5-min ceiling -- a
# replacement that STILL hasn't heartbeat after 120s is genuinely broken and eligible again.

#      package's four scripts by full path, but whose pid is NOT the current heartbeat
#      owner for that instanceId. A bare/interactive powershell.exe (the operator's own
#      terminals) never matches the script-path test and is never touched. A non-owner
#      that still has a live node.exe child is mid-call -- reported, left alone; it either
#      finishes and exits or crashes and becomes reapable next pass.
#   2. Orphaned llama-server.exe: one whose parent pid is not a LIVE ollama.exe. Ollama is
#      the only thing that ever spawns llama-server, so a dead/mismatched parent means a
#      VRAM squatter from a killed server -- the #1 manual cleanup of the incident night,
#      and safe to kill unconditionally: it cannot be doing legitimate work for a server
#      that no longer exists.
