// detector (Grimmethy, 2026-08-22, "Build [this] now" -- see queue/blocked/
// adhoc-build-a-staleness-audit-... for the full spec this implements). Finds individual
// queue/blocked/ or queue/needs-clarification/ tasks whose underlying premise is likely
// no longer worth chasing -- either it's sat untouched past a staleness threshold, or it
// was rejected for fabrication/hallucination repeatedly -- and, for each one, files a real
// task asking the harness-grounded local model to recheck whether the concern still holds
// against CURRENT repo state (see task-sources.js's nextStalenessAuditTask() for how this
// module's pure functions get called, and local-draft.js's own 'staleness_audit' branch
// for the harness-grounded plan/implement pass that does the actual rechecking).
//
// Deliberately mirrors pipeline-self-audit.js's own shape (deterministic filter here, no
// model call; the real judgment call -- "is this still true" -- happens later, in the
// filed task's own harness-grounded draft pass, same division of labor pipeline_self_audit
// already uses) -- but the unit here is ONE TASK, not a cluster of >=5 sharing a failure
// signature, since staleness is a per-task property (age, its own rejection history) that
// clustering would only obscure.
//
// This module ONLY detects and describes -- it never touches queue/ files itself. The
// filed task's own implement pass produces a real recommendation ('archive' or 'worth a
// fresh investigation') which, once it clears an independent review vote, DOES have a
// real automatic effect (2026-08-23, Grimmethy: "We need to remove the human part of that
// step" -- see staleness-auto-archive.js for the actual archiving mechanism and its
// safety scoping; this module still never performs that action itself).
