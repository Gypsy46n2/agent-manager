// source.next() synchronously, and threading a Promise through every call site in that
// chain for the sake of one check would be a much bigger, riskier change than this is
// worth. Confirmed live 2026-08-15: project_search tasks kept getting drafted and dumped
// into queue/blocked/ in bulk while the internet connection was down -- nothing upstream
// ever checked connectivity BEFORE spending a plan+implement pass on a task guaranteed to
// fail the moment project-search-fetch.js's real GitHub/HuggingFace calls came up empty.
//
// Cached briefly (see CACHE_MS) so multiple checks within the same worker tick (or across
// different next*Task() functions) don't each pay a fresh network round-trip -- a real
// probe only actually runs once every CACHE_MS at most.
