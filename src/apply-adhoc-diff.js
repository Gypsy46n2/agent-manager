// (task.rawDiff) by editing an isolated git worktree directly; this function's only job
// is landing that diff onto the real repoRoot apply-task.js has already fetched/reset/
// branched by the time this runs.
//
// task.rawDiff empty (adhoc-agentic-draft.js's agentic call decided nothing needed to
// change, or something went wrong upstream) -- skipped, same {skipped, reason} shape
// apply-task.js already handles for applyBrainDumpSort/applyProjectSearchFindings/etc.
// Deliberately NOT gated on task.adhocResolution's own claim -- an empty diff always
// means "nothing to apply" regardless of what the model said, and a non-empty diff
// always goes through the normal git-apply + human-gated Apply click regardless of what
// the model said. See adhoc-agentic-draft.js's own comment on this.
