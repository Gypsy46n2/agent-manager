# results. Every one of these external sources can legitimately contain a real leaked
# credential (an accidentally-committed .env, a hardcoded test key in a README, etc.) --
# and until this fix, ornith-worker.ps1/review-runner.ps1/queue-watchdog.ps1 all wrote
# planResponse/implementResponse/critique/review reasoning straight to a shared markdown
# log (Ornith Live Log.md, which can live in a synced SecondBrain vault) with zero
# scrubbing. This is a defense-in-depth net for THAT path specifically -- it does not touch

# Adapted from mission-control's buildSafeEnv (scripts/daemon/security.ts) -- flagged by
# Grimmethy (2026-07-21) as a project worth learning from. That project strips a spawned
# Claude Code session down to an allowlisted environment before it runs, since it's a real
# agentic process with tool access (git, filesystem) receiving prompt content the agent
# itself didn't write. The Ornith-calling functions here share the same shape of risk, just
# smaller: deep_dive/project_search/arch_import build prompts that embed real, UNTRUSTED
# third-party content (cloned external repo source, fetched GitHub/HuggingFace search
# results) verbatim, and hand that prompt to a spawned `node ornith-client.js` process.
# Ornith itself has no tool access (a local Ollama text completion, nothing more) so this
# is narrower than mission-control's threat model -- but the spawned node process, by
# default, inherits this PowerShell session's ENTIRE environment, including anything
# sitting there that has nothing to do with agent-manager (a personal API key in the
# user's shell profile, unrelated cloud credentials, etc.). None of that has any legitimate
# reason to be visible to a subprocess whose only job is "send this prompt to Ollama and
# return the response" -- so it's excluded by default rather than blindly inherited.
#
# Scope: applied to the Ornith-calling functions (Invoke-OrnithClient, Invoke-
# OrnithMajorityVote, Invoke-OrnithToolClient) specifically, since those are the ones whose
# prompt content is built partly from untrusted external material. The many other node
# subprocess calls in this pipeline (fact-checker.js, arch-import-fetch.js, apply-group-*,
# task-db, model-stats-db, etc.) are deterministic, non-agentic, and mostly operate on
# already-local/already-fetched data -- lower marginal value for the same risk of touching
# a working call site, left alone for now. `claude -p` (review-runner.ps1's 'claude'
# provider path) is the single highest-value remaining target -- real agentic tool access,
# same untrusted-content exposure -- but its native `&` invocation shape doesn't support
# per-call env overrides the way this Remove-Item/Set-Item wrapper does; it needs a
# ProcessStartInfo-based rewrite and live verification against a real Claude Code session,
# which wasn't done here (REVIEW_PROVIDER defaults to 'ornith' and wasn't the active path
# tonight, so there was no safe way to verify a rewrite live). Flagged as a follow-up.
