# NO branch at all. This section closes that gap: list what's pushed-but-unmerged, and let
# a human merge one with a single click instead of the manual clone/branch/merge/push/sync
# dance that incident required.
#
# PACKAGE_ROOT (this dashboard's own repo) and get_active_repo_root() (the repo the
# pipeline drafts/pushes against) can be two different checkouts of the SAME remote --
# confirmed live this same incident: an agent-manager "live" deployment and an
# "agent-manager-apply-target" consumer checkout. Branches are listed/merged against the
# ACTIVE REPO ROOT (where they were actually pushed); the live sync step below is what
