rem Starts the dashboard -- the actual entry point now. agent-manager.env is OPTIONAL: if
rem it doesn't exist yet, or doesn't have AGENT_MANAGER_REPO_ROOT set, this skips starting
rem the 4 pipeline loops and just opens the dashboard, where the Project tab's "Start
rem Pipeline" button on a browsed folder does the rest (writes agent-manager.env itself,
rem then launches the 4 loops) -- no manual config-file-editing step required for the
rem common case. Power users who want non-default settings (SECOND_BRAIN_DIR,
rem AGENT_MANAGER_REGISTER_PATH, etc) can still hand-edit agent-manager.env; copy
rem agent-manager.env.example to create it, same as before.
